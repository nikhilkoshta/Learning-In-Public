# Full-Stack Web Development Journey

Hey there, fellow developers and learners! Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I document my full-stack web development journey. I am a passionate learner and an aspiring full-stack web developer, eager to delve into the exciting world of web technologies and build meaningful projects.

## About Me

I'm Nikhil Koshta, a 3rd year college student, freelance video editor and a coding enthusiast. Now I'm trying my hands on Full-stack web development. I've always been intrigued by the way websites and web applications work. The ability to create something from scratch and make it accessible to millions of users worldwide excites me. My goal is to become proficient in various aspects of web development and contribute to the ever-growing web ecosystem.

## Goals and Objectives

In the field of web development, my primary objectives are:

1. Mastering front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create visually appealing and interactive user interfaces.
2. Gaining proficiency in popular front-end frameworks like React.js to build dynamic and responsive web applications.
3. Developing back-end skills using Node.js and exploring databases like MongoDB to create robust server-side applications.
4. Understanding the principles of full-stack development and successfully integrating front-end and back-end components into cohesive projects.
5. Learning about deployment, scaling, and optimizing web applications for optimal performance.

## Learning Approach

To achieve my goals, I follow a combination of daily practice and project-based learning. I am also following a Full-stack web development course on 'Udemy' taught by Angela Yu. I believe in the power of hands-on experience, and I'm excited to share my progress with the developer community. By learning in public, I hope to receive valuable feedback, exchange ideas, and inspire others on their own journeys.

## Repository Structure

In this repository, you'll find the following categories or folders to organize my content:

1. **Learning Logs:** This section will include daily or weekly logs, detailing the topics I've studied, challenges I faced, and the progress I made.
2. **Projects:** Here, I'll showcase the projects I work on to apply my learning and demonstrate my skills.
3. **Tutorials:** In this section, I might create tutorials on specific topics or concepts to help other learners understand complex subjects better.
4. **Resources:** This folder will contain useful resources, such as links to tutorials, articles, and recommended books related to web development.

## Future Plans

I have ambitious plans for the future, including:

- Building a full-fledged web application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack.
- Exploring additional front-end libraries and frameworks like Angular and Svelte.
- Implementing real-time features with technologies like WebSocket or Socket.io.
- Learning about web security and best practices for secure web application development.
